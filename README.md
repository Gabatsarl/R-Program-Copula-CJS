#  This work supervise the function
#  It also provides the R-code needed:
#  1-to fit the proposed model  by maximum likelihood and to get Table 6
#  2- to redo the residual analysis on pages 38-39
#  3- to draw  Figures 5 &6, 

#   The R-code in this file uses the R-functions in Functions.R
#  that needs to be sourced before running the code in this file.
